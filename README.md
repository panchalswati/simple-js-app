# Pokédex app
Created a small Pokédex app to display a list of Pokémon with the details which are loaded from an external API.
I developed a complete, fully functioning JavaScript web application which displays data on demand. 

Key Features of the Pokédex app are:
● Load data from an external source (API)- the Pokédex app(https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=150)
● View a list of items
● View details of the item on user click action.

Technical requirements:
•	The app has additional complex UI pattern, such as modal,form,navbar.
•	The app has CSS styling.
•	Implemented Bootstrap
•	The JavaScript code is formatted according to ESLint rules.
•	The JavaScript code is also formatted via Prettier. 
•	The app is deployed to a publicly accessible platform Guthub (https://panchalswati.github.io/simple-js-app/)
•	The app will work on popular browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Edge,Opera and Internet Explorer 11.
